# README

Model_Upload_HF.py - Script to upload completed model to Hugging Face repository.

T5 Equation.py - Final script that trains t5-small Seq2Seq model on MWAPS_Augmented.csv (included in DATA directory) to translate word problem to equation.

hugging_face_upload.py - Script to upload completed model to Hugging Face repository.

hyperparameter_tuning.py - Script to run pre-training to select optimal hyperparameters for the model.

t5_successful.py - Final script that trains t5-small Seq2Seq model on train.csv (included in DATA directory) to generate numeric answer to word problem.

tensorboard_onnx.py - Script snippet to generate tensorboard output and onnx model layer visualization.

dataclass.py - Code snippet to build custom training datasets. Ultimately incorporated with final training scripts.

streamlit.py - Code for our final project report (images in Images directory required for app).

Note that all code in legacy directory was written but ultimately not used.
